<div class=preview__img><div class=preview__img-inner id=img1 style=background-image:url(img/research/panji-panataran.jpg)></div></div>
<div class=preview__desc>Even though Panji is a quintessential Javanese Majapahit story, there is no original Panji manuscript from Majapahit era that still exists today. Yet, all retellings of Panji tales still maintain similar settings and themes, which is indicative of the high regards to cultural root of the stories. Similarly, the book that this project is based on, "Hikayat Panji Semirang", was written in Bahasa Melayu and printed in Singapore, but still uses Majapahit-era Java as the setting. In adapting the tales for 360imx, this project will also draw inspirations from Majapahit culture. However, it will also highlights the relationships between Southeast Asian cultures during the time, making in an adaptation that spans "across the sea".</div>

<div class=preview__desc>While Panji tales have been traditionally performed using classic shadow puppets, the characters featured in this project are animated and stylised in the form of modern shadow puppets with perforated looks and more proportional figures. The perforations applied to the characters follow traditional Batik motifs which have existed since Majapahit era.

<h2>The Setting: Panji & Majapahit</h2>
<p>The origin of Panji stories was thought to be from the 13th century East Java or earlier, as suggested by the inclusion of the kingdom "Singhasari" in some versions of the stories that exist today<sup><a href=#munoz2016>[1]</a></sup><sup><a href=#liaw2013>[2]</a></sup>. Singhasari was the precursor kingdom of Majapahit, and the histories of the two kingdoms were always interlinked that it would be difficult not to mention the former kingdom while discussing the latter one<sup><a href=#slametmuljana>[3]</a></sup>. While it is likely that Panji stories had existed since before Majapahit era, the stories grew to become popular during Majapahit era. This is evident from the depictions of Panji that were carved in numerous Majapahit-era temples<sup><a href=#kieven2017>[4]</a></sup>. Some Panji scholars also believed that the spread of the stories to other regions in Southeast Asia was linked to the expansion of Majapahit kingdom during its heyday<sup><a href=#vickers2020>[5]</a></sup><sup><a href=#manuaba>[6]</a></sup>, though some others believed that it happened much later<sup><a href=#kieven2017>[4]</a></sup><sup><a href=#liaw2013>[2]</a></sup>. </p>

</figure>
<p>While Panji is a quintessentially Javanese Majapahit story, there has never been a true, original Majapahit Panji manuscript that exists today that we can refer to<sup><a href=#musnas2019>[7]</a></sup>. In fact, most well-known Panji stories that exist today were invented and popularised much closer to current time<sup><a href=#liaw2013>[2]</a></sup>. This might be because the original stories of Panji were spread around mostly through performances, oral communications, and paintings or other arts instead of written manuscripts<sup><a href=#vickers2020>[5]</a></sup><sup><a href=#manuaba>[6]</a></sup>. Yet, all retellings, even the ones from other countries, still maintain the same (or similar) settings and themes, which is indicative of the high regards of the people who adapted the stories to the geographical origin and cultural root of the stories<sup><a href=#kieven2013>[8]</a></sup><sup><a href=#kieven2017>[4]</a></sup>. </p>
<p>In adapting "Hikayat Panji Semirang" for 360imx, this project will also mostly draw inspirations from Majapahit culture. For example, the layout of palaces and temple complexes, the attire of the characters, and the depictions of food, trades, and other objects are all inspired from archaeological findings, artefacts, and other accounts from Majapahit era. However, as the title of the project implies ("Panji Across SEA"), the emphasis of the project is on the relationships between Southeast Asian countries during pre-colonial times, with Panji as the story that unifies this idea. As such, this project will also feature some objects and traditions from other countries in Southeast Asia in order to enrich the story and match it to the underlying theme. The inspiration to take this approach comes from the book that this project is adapted from. While the story of "Panji Semirang" is still set in Java, the book was written in Bahasa Melayu and printed in Singapore, making it a perfect example of an adaptation that spans "across the sea".</p>

</figure>
<p>The book originally mentioned four places as the set of the Panji Semirang story, which are: Kuripan (Kahuripan), Daha (Kediri), Gagelang, and Mount Wilis. Kahuripan and Daha were considered the two most important provinces of Majapahit, according to the accounts in Nagara-kertagama<sup><a href=#pigeaud>[9]</a></sup><sup><a href=#munoz2016>[1]</a></sup>. The compound of Kahuripan is estimated to be at present-day Surabaya, while Daha stood at where Kediri is now<sup><a href=#pigeaud>[9]</a></sup>. There was no mention of Gagelang (or Gegelang, or sometimes Gelang-Gelang), in Nagara-kertagama, but it is believed that the territory/province was established only towards the end of Majapahit and has now become known as the city Madiun<sup><a href=#hanif>[10]</a></sup><sup><a href=#detik2014>[11]</a></sup>. Mount Wilis retains its name until today. As the project is split into three parts (Act 1: Raden Inu, Act 2: Candra Kirana, and Act 3: Gagelang), it will zoom into Kahuripan, Daha, and Gagelang as the background setting for each act.</p>

<h2>Character Design: Shadow Puppets</h2>
<p>All characters featured in this project are animated and stylised in the form of modern shadow puppets. While Panji tales have been traditionally performed using classic shadow puppet ("<em>wayang</em>"), the use of more "contemporary" design would be more appropriate for a digital adaptation since it allows aesthetic innovations that focus more on the story and themes instead of traditional forms and rituals<sup><a href=#escobar>[1]</a></sup>.</p>
<figure>
<img src=img/research/wayang-bocor.jpg alt="wayang bocor">
<figcaption>A contemporary Indonesian shadow puppet. <em>Source: <a href=https://wayangbocor.com/karakter-wayang-agar-agar-bertanduk/ target=_blank>Wayang Bocor</a></em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In designing the characters with a modern twist, the style of perforated shadow puppets with proportional figures is chosen so that it can feature traditional Batik motifs. The use of more proportional human figures is also present in carvings and statues found in early Javanese sites and temples<sup><a href=#winaya>[2]</a></sup><sup><a href=#kieven20132>[3]</a></sup><sup><a href=#kerlogue>[4]</a></sup>. Thus, a different form of authenticity to the original culture is still maintained even without the use of traditional <em>wayang</em>. The perforated style of shadow puppets can also be traced to many different places (such as China, Malaysia, Thailand, India, and even as far as Egypt)<sup><a href=#chen>[5]</a></sup>, which would allow better recognitions of the characters by audiences who are not familiar with traditional <em>wayang</em>, considering the short amount of time each character will be displayed on screen. </p>

</figure>
<p>The characters' attires also follow the general principles of dressing attires of the men in Majapahit era. Both male and female characters are wearing one or two-layered cloth stretched to ankle ("<em>kain Panjang</em>"); the males are bare-chested, while the females are wearing additional upper garments. These descriptions are based on statues of Majapahit Kings and Queens from the 14th century<sup><a href=#pcbm>[6]</a></sup><sup><a href=#mni>[7]</a></sup>, the accounts of Ma Huan (a Chinese traveller who accompanied Cheng Ho during his visit to Java in 15th century)<sup><a href=#ma1433>[8]</a></sup>, and reliefs found from Majapahit temples. </p>

</figure>
<p>Since the characters are of noble and/or royal origins, they will also be decorated with upper arm bracelets, layered wrist bracelets, necklace, ear coverings, and headgear. The Batik motifs decorating the characters are in the variations of "<em>kawung</em>", "<em>ceplok</em>", and "<em>parang</em>" motifs. The first two motifs have been found in historical figures depicting Kings and Queens of Majapahit, while the last one is the motif most commonly associated with Javanese royalties<sup><a href=#kerlogue>[4]</a></sup>. </p>
<p>As for the face, it will generally follow the principles used in traditional dance masks. The characters will have thin, curly / arched eyebrows, stretched eyelines, curly lips, and decorative element on the forehead<sup><a href=#suwasono>[9]</a></sup>. </p>

<h2>Batik Patterns</h2>
<p>Did you know that Batik technique has already existed during Majapahit era or even before? Batik patterns have been featured in some of the archaeological statues found from Majapahit and pre-Majapahit era, such as Candi Prambanan and Candi Singhasari<sup><a href=#setyawan>[1]</a></sup><sup><a href=#sardjono>[2]</a></sup>. The Batik patterns which were found in the statues and reliefs are mostly of <em>lereng</em>, <em>ceplok</em>, and <em>kawung</em><sup><a href=#kerlogue2>[3]</a></sup><sup><a href=#natanegara>[4]</a></sup><sup><a href=#fraser>[5]</a></sup><sup><a href=#sardjono>[2]</a></sup>. Batik cloths are also popular in Malaysia and Thailand (mostly the southern part). Coincidentally, these countries are also where Panji stories are popular. In this project, the three traditional Javanese Batik patterns are liberally applied in the characters design, but patterns from Malaysian, Southern Thailand, and even Singapore are also featured in some of the scenes. </p>
<p><b><em>Kawung</em></b>: this motif is said to represent the fruit of a sugar palm (arenga saccharifera)<sup><a href=#haake>[6]</a></sup>. With four lozenges around a centre, the motif is seen as the perfect visual expression of “<em>mancapat</em>”, the old Javanese philosophical belief of balance<sup><a href=#swallow>[7]</a></sup>. Because of this philosophical meaning, the <em>kawung</em> motif used to be restricted for use by members of the royal household only<sup><a href=#kerlogue2>[3]</a></sup>. This Batik motif was featured in a statue from the 14th century depicting the first king and founder of Majapahit Kingdom, Raden Wijaya<sup><a href=#setyawan>[1]</a></sup><sup><a href=#fraser>[5]</a></sup><sup><a href=#sardjono>[2]</a></sup>. </p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p><b><em>Ceplok</em></b>: this motif has repetitive geometrical patterns, mostly of squares and circles. It is used to depict forms of nature, such as flowers (opened up and seen from above), fruits, birds, insects, or fish<sup><a href=#adam>[8]</a></sup><sup><a href=#hamzuri>[9]</a></sup>. The word “<em>ceplok</em>” means metal clasp ornament with roses, stars, and other little things<sup><a href=#adam>[8]</a></sup><sup><a href=#haake>[6]</a></sup>. Ceplok patterns that feature flowers and stars ("<em>truntum</em>") are often used to symbolise love, or falling in love, and thus quite frequently used by lovers or as wedding attires<sup><a href=#hamzuri>[9]</a></sup><sup><a href=#kerlogue2>[3]</a></sup>. Ceplok motif is also featured in the statue of Raden Wijaya and other reliefs found from Majapahit temples<sup><a href=#fraser>[5]</a></sup><sup><a href=#sardjono>[2]</a></sup>.</p>

</figure>
<p><b><em>Lereng</em></b>: this motif has inclining border, taken from the word “<em>lereng</em>” which also means “<em>garis miring</em>” (diagonal line). The most popular example of <em>lereng</em> motif is <em>parang</em>, which means dagger, but the motif is also used to symbolise either sunbeams or lotus blossoms<sup><a href=#haake>[6]</a></sup><sup><a href=#swallow>[7]</a></sup>. In Javanese arts, the <em>parang</em> motif is usually associated with youths and bravery, so it is popularly worn by young noblemen<sup><a href=#adam>[8]</a></sup><sup><a href=#kerlogue2>[3]</a></sup>. A specific pattern in the same group, called “<em>parang rusak</em>” used to be reserved only for the king’s sons and daughters, brothers, and uncles<sup><a href=#adam>[8]</a></sup><sup><a href=#kerlogue2>[3]</a></sup>. The giant form of this motif, “<em>parang rusak barong</em>”, could only be worn by the king, his wife, and his first son<sup><a href=#haake>[6]</a></sup>.</p><p>

</figure>
</p><p><b><em>Pucuk rebung</em></b>: In contrast to Javanese traditional Batik patterns, the Malaysian counterparts usually have more prominent geometrical patterns and are less concerned with strict philosophical guidelines<sup><a href=#syed>[10]</a></sup>. Batik in Malaysia has never been regarded as the main dressing code of the royal households<sup><a href=#yunus>[11]</a></sup>. Floral patterns are the most common Batik motifs in Malaysia. Of this, the pattern <em>pucuk rebung</em> (bamboo shoot), with prominent triangular elements, is one of the more well-known styles that are still being used even until today<sup><a href=#syed>[10]</a></sup>.</p>

</figure>
<p><b><em>Pikul</em></b>: Batik techniques were only more widely adopted by the Thais around 17th century, when the Javanese Batik creators had much improved their techniques for better exports<sup><a href=#hall>[12]</a></sup>. As a result, the Thais had more liberties in designing their Batik. Floral and geometrical motifs remained popular, but there were also more abstract patterns<sup><a href=#khwansuwan>[13]</a></sup>. The Thais also blended influences from the Malays and Chinese, and designed the patterns not just for textiles, but also for ceramic arts and crafts. A pattern called “<em>Pikul</em>”, which is the provincial flower of Narathiwat Province, is still used today as its local identity<sup><a href=#malisuwan>[14]</a></sup>.</p>

<h2>Gamelan Music</h2>
<p>Gamelan had already existed during Majapahit era as it was mentioned in Nagara-kertagama (the 14th century poem written by Mpu Prapanca in Majapahit). It was described as a set of instruments that are not large, as the ensembles would have to be carried from place to place to accompany dances and theatrical performances at both the Court and the countryside<sup><a href="#pigeaud">[1]</a></sup>. Due to this general description, it is then believed that the instruments used in 14th century Majapahit era would be different to the ones found in Central Javanese <em>kraton</em> (palace) today<sup><a href="#kunst">[2]</a></sup>. </p>
<p>The book "Hikayat Panji Semirang" provides a glimpse of the type of performance that was popular during the period of time. A portion of the story describes Candra Kirana and her loyal followers travelling in disguise as <em>gambuh</em> performers. While the book does not specifically define the performers as <em>gambuh</em> musicians, dancers, or singers, it can be assumed that their performances would have been accompanied by a specific type of Gamelan music with the same name.  </p>
<p>Here is how the <em>gambuh</em> Gamelan instruments are described in <a href="https://doi-org.libproxy1.nus.edu.sg/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.L2268105" target="_blank">Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://doi-org.libproxy1.nus.edu.sg/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.L2268105">&#8220;The ancient Gamelan <em>gambuh</em>, used to accompany the courtly <em>gambuh</em> dance drama, is dominated by the long, resonant <em>gambuh</em> <em>suling</em> bamboo flutes which can exceed a metre in length. A <em>rebeb</em> spike fiddle is added to the several <em>suling</em> to elaborate the principal melody. The usual battery of two <em>kendang</em>, <em>klenang</em>, and <em>ceng-ceng</em> are included alongside a suspended <em>kempur</em>, <em>kemenak</em> metal tubes, and the <em>kangsi</em> chime. A <em>kajar</em> gong chime reinforces the patterns performed on the <em>kendang</em>.&#8221;</blockquote>

</figure>
<p>It is worth noting that while all these instruments have existed for the longest time in Java, some of them did eventually lose their popularity within the region in favour of other types of Gamelan music. However, while they become rarer in Java, they can still be found today in Bali as <em>gambuh</em> had never lost its popularity in the island ever since the Hindu populace of Majapahit migrated there<sup><a href="#kunst">[2]</a></sup>. Some other instruments, such as <em>suling</em> and <em>rebab</em>, also find their popularities in other cultures, such as the Malay community in Peninsular Malaysia and the peoples of the southern Philippines<sup><a href="#kartomi">[3]</a></sup><sup><a href="#matusky">[4]</a></sup>.</p>

<h2>Traditional Kuih</h2>
<p>One defining moment in Candra Kirana's story in "Hikayat Panji Semirang" is when her mother, the Queen of Daha, was poisoned by one of the King's consorts who was jealous of her. The book used "<em>tape</em>" (or "<em>tapai</em>") as the snack in which the poison was placed in. Did you know that this snack has also existed since Majapahit time? In presenting the traditional <em>kueh</em> (snack) as part of the interactive elements in the scene, this project will also tap into other types of <em>kueh</em> that can be traced back to other SEA communities. </p>

</figure>
<p><em>Tape</em> (<em>tapai</em>): There are two types of <em>tape</em> that are still widely available today in both Indonesia and Malaysia: one with glutinuous rice (<em>tape ketan</em>) and one with cassava (<em>tape singkong</em>). Even though the book "Hikayat Panji Semirang" did not specifically mention which type of <em>tape</em> that was being used in the poisoning, based on the culinary traditions traced from the descendants of Majapahit community in Trowulan, the most likely type of <em>tape</em> that existed during Majapahit era was <em>tape ketan</em><sup><a href="#hendra">[1]</a></sup>. The preparation of <em>tape</em> for both <em>tape ketan</em> and <em>tape singkong</em> involves fermenting the basic ingredients for a few days with sugar and yeast. </p>

</figure>
<p><em>Wajik</em> and <em>dodol</em>: This snack is believed to have been existed since Majapahit era<sup><a href="#hendra">[1]</a></sup>. It originated from Central Java<sup><a href="#ismail">[2]</a></sup><sup><a href="#afifah">[3]</a></sup>. The snack is also popular in Brunei, where it is known as <em>wajid</em><sup><a href="#hussin">[4]</a></sup>. It is believed to be a variant of <em>dodol</em>, which is also a snack that has existed since Majapahit era<sup><a href="#hendra">[1]</a></sup>. <em>dodol</em> is popular in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand, where it is perhaps more well-known as <em>kalamea</em><sup><a href="#ismail">[2]</a></sup>. In Yogyakarta, Indonesia, <em>wajik</em> snack is still an essential element of the <em>kraton</em> (palace) custom and it is still used in traditional ceremonies and festivals<sup><a href="#numplak">[5]</a></sup>.</p>

</figure>
<p><em>Kuih lapis</em>: While <em>kuih lapis</em> might have more modern origins (it is popularised as a Nyonya cuisine<sup><a href="#raji">[6]</a></sup>), the snack has been popular in Southern China territories<sup><a href="#nasrallah">[7]</a></sup> and it comes under many names and colours. Some examples are the Vietnamese cake <em>bánh da lợn</em> and Cambodian <em>num chak chan</em>. Indonesia also has the baked version of kue lapis which is often called “<em>kue lapis legit</em>” to differentiate the types. This baked <em>kue lapis</em> originates from the Dutch colonial era inspired by European layer cakes<sup><a href="#reber">[8]</a></sup><sup><a href="#liwong">[9]</a></sup>. Even though the exact time period when steamed <em>kuih lapis</em> came to Southeast Asia is not fully known, there were already documented Chinese immigrants in Java during Majapahit era, so it is possible that they would have brought their cooking techniques then or in later period of time. </p>

</figure>
<p><em>Ondeh-ondeh</em> or <em>klepon</em>: <em>ondeh-ondeh</em> is believed to have originated from the peranakan community (Nyonya cuisine), similar to <em>kuih lapis</em><sup><a href="#ong">[10]</a></sup>. It is thought to originate from a similarly shaped Chinese snack, but the fillings were localised by the Southeast Asians to use the more readily available gula malaka (palm sugar) instead. In Indonesia, <em>ondeh-ondeh</em> is also a name for other type of round-shaped snack (likely closer to the original Chinese snack), and so the name klepon is more commonly used in Indonesia to describe the same snack as Malaysian <em>ondeh-ondeh</em>. It is believed the snack is also available in Thailand under a different name<sup><a href="#isam">[11]</a></sup>. The preparation of <em>ondeh-ondeh</em> is also similar to the snack <em>moun lon yei bo</em> in Myanmar, albeit without the green colourings<sup><a href="#duguid">[12]</a></sup>.</p>
