Singhasari was the precursor kingdom of Majapahit, and the histories of the two kingdoms were always interlinked that it would be difficult not to mention the former kingdom while discussing the latter one<sup><a href=#slametmuljana>[3]</a></sup>. While it is likely that Panji stories had existed since before Majapahit era, the stories grew to become popular during Majapahit era. This is evident from the depictions of Panji that were carved in numerous Majapahit-era temples<sup><a href=#kieven2017>[4]</a></sup>. Some Panji scholars also believed that the spread of the stories to other regions in Southeast Asia was linked to the expansion of Majapahit kingdom during its heyday<sup><a href=#vickers2020>[5]</a></sup><sup><a href=#manuaba>[6]</a></sup>, though some others believed that it happened much later<sup><a href=#kieven2017>[4]</a></sup><sup><a href=#liaw2013>[2]</a></sup>.<figure><img alt="majapahit map"src=img/research/majapahit.png><figcaption>Map of Majapahit Kingdom circa 13th Century. <em>Source: Wikimedia</em></figcaption></figure><p>While Panji is a quintessentially Javanese Majapahit story, there has never been a true, original Majapahit Panji manuscript that exists today that we can refer to<sup><a href=#museum2019>[7]</a></sup>. In fact, most well-known Panji stories that exist today were invented and popularised much closer to current time<sup><a href=#liaw2013>[2]</a></sup>. This might be because the original stories of Panji were spread around mostly through performances, oral communications, and paintings or other arts instead of written manuscripts<sup><a href=#vickers2020>[5]</a></sup><sup><a href=#manuaba>[6]</a></sup>. Yet, all retellings, even the ones from other countries, still maintain the same (or similar) settings and themes, which is indicative of the high regards of the people who adapted the stories to the geographical origin and cultural root of the stories<sup><a href=#kieven2013>[8]</a></sup><sup><a href=#kieven2017>[4]</a></sup>.<p>In adapting “Hikayat Panji Semirang” for 360imx, this project will also mostly draw inspirations from Majapahit culture. For example, the layout of palaces and temple complexes, the attire of the characters, and the depictions of food, trades, and other objects are all inspired from archaeological findings, artefacts, and other accounts from Majapahit era. However, as the title of the project implies (“Panji Across SEA”), the emphasis of the project is on the relationships between Southeast Asian countries during pre-colonial times, with Panji as the story that unifies this idea. As such, this project will also feature some objects and traditions from other countries in Southeast Asia in order to enrich the story and match it to the underlying theme. While this project aims to be as faithful as possible to the original root of Panji, some objects featured in this project might also be slightly anachronistic to the era due to limitations of access to the more authentic and original materials.</p><br><p class=footnote id=munoz2016>[1] Munoz, P.
